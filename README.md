# Sudoku Solver

A graphical Sudoku solver built with Python and Tkinter that features both instant and step-by-step solving visualization.

## Features
- Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid
- Instant solve mode
- Step-by-step visualization showing backtracking algorithm
- Input validation
- Color-coded 3x3 blocks

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## How to Use
1. Run the program: `python sudoku_solver.py`
2. Enter known numbers in the grid
3. Click "Solve Instantly" for immediate solution
4. Click "Solve Step-by-Step" to watch the algorithm work
5. Use "Clear" to reset the board

## Algorithm
The solver uses a backtracking algorithm that recursively tries numbers 1-9 in empty cells until a valid solution is found.
